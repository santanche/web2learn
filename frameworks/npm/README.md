NPM
===

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the package manager for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) but also serves JavaScript browser applications.

Here we present three examples of a JavaScript app using an external library:
1. downloading the library source (`source` directory); 
2. referencing a remote pre-mounted library in a CDN (Content Delivery Network) site (`cdn` directory);
3. mounting a local image through NPM ( `npm` directory).
