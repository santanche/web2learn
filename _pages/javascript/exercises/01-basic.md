## Exercise 2

Write a JavaScript program that, given any object, displays the relationship between fields and values on a Web page in the form of a table, as shown in the following example:

Example of object:

~~~javascript
{
  name: 'Asdrubal',
  age: 45,
  book: 'Life of Dinosaurs'
}
~~~

Respective table as presented on the page:

| field | value             |
|-------|-------------------|
| name  | Asdrubal          |
| age   | 45                |
| book  | Life of Dinosaurs |

This is only an example. You may use it to test your program, but your program must be generic to afford any object.

Consider that all objects have only one level, without objects (or arrays) inside objects.
